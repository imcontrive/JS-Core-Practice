# Callback Function

A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name `call back`.

In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as `arguments`, and can be `returned` by other functions. Functions that do this are called `higher-order functions`. 

Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution.

### Higher Order Function
Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.
